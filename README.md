Bogart: Sinatra for PHP
=======================

This is Bogart, Sinatra for PHP. We can't get as consise as Ruby, but can at least try.

Examples
-------

    <?php
    
    Get('/hello', function(){
      echo 'hello world';
    });

    Get('/hello/:name', function($request)
    {
      # matches "GET /hello/foo" and "GET /hello/bar"
      # params[name] is 'foo' or 'bar'
      echo 'Hello '.$request->params['name'].'!';
    });

Requires
--------

- PHP 5.3
- MongoDB

Decisions So Far
----------------

- Sinatra is awesome. Copy it.
- MongoDB required, no ORM, no models. # use jwage's ODM?
- KISS. Refactor if things get complictated. # we're getting there
- PHP 5.3 only. Don't be afraid.
- Git, GitHub, MIT License.
- Anonymous functions for actions.
- Splats (*), regex and :named routes.
- No plugins. Just extend + use that if you need to. # would be nice to architect this in
- Config in yaml.
- Include all the PHP libs we need ourselves. But rely on good existing 3rd party libs where reasonable.
- Use mod_rewrite to keep static urls in templates reasonable. # any other reason?
- Try to stay away from view helpers. Simple templates are better.
- Supply the basic template rendering methods. # not any more!
- Keep the file structure mostly flat. Not too many classes. # sinatra is 2 files!
- Minimal file-based cache, only where absolutely required. Commit to MongoDB as much as possible.
- No built in shit like blogs or comments or user or whatever. # added user. working on email.
- Don't impose a user auth model. Use Twitter or Facebook for that. # too late!
- PHP is better when public folder doesn't include libs but shared servers don't play nice. Pick one. # shared server unfriendly so far, apparently
- Would like i18n. Need to find a way to support/integrate that.

Change Log
----------

Version 0.1-ALPHA
- This will be the first release. Meant to be somewhat stable and usable in non-critical projects.

TODO
----

- Get Bogart working with no DB access
- Switch all routes to event handlers to allow things like filters, error handling, etc. # really?
- Make funcs for Error/NotFound.
- halt
- helpers
- Tests with PHPUnit
- execute another route from within an action.
- message queue system # maybe ignore this
- email class (SwiftMailer?)
- add sass css renderer
- what to do with javascript? new string renderer or does HTML work?
- allow strings to be passed to templates instead of filenames
