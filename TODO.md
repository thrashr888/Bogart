TODO
====

- Get Bogart working with no DB access
- Switch all routes to event handlers to allow things like filters, error handling, etc. # really?
- Make funcs for ``Error/NotFound``
- ``halt``
- helpers for templates
- Tests with PHPUnit # place in ``/tests`` folder
- execute another route from within an action
- message queue system # maybe ignore this
- email class (``SwiftMailer``?)
- add ``sass css`` renderer # doesn't seem practical for PHP
- what to do with javascript? new string renderer or does HTML work?
- allow strings to be passed to templates instead of filenames
- inline templates. use the ``Template`` function like a route
